# filter-operation
# I used my ecommerce database for select query to filter them by BETWEEN , AND , OR etc.. it makes them filter with kind of orders or item that we need.

# It was used to easy to calculate the purchase, persons and more, it was kind work that we should understand the query to write an without an error.

# First was insert some data with the query that we need to add with tables and columns and then start write query for filter them with between and mensions what that we need.

# I write select query to filter the tables and mentions the similar rows to we filter date or amount that we need to filter them with this kind of column.


# Between used to calculate something like 24 to 30 it was calculate middle numbers that were used between and mensions and also that was easy to achives.

# Real-world benchmarks show that sometimes an OR-based approach is faster, other times a UNION ALL strategy, superiorâ€”it depends on indexes, data distribution, and SQL optimizer behavior.
